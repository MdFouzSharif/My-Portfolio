        <div><h1>Laser Cutting</span></h1><br><br>
            
            <p> Laser cutting machines utilize high power-density laser beams to irradiate on the workpiece surface, causing the materials to melt, evaporate and undergo chemical reactions.At the same time, the molten materials will blown off by high-speed airflow, and the cutting is finished.

                Generally, laser cutting can be divided into 4 parts:
                
                Irradiated by laser beams, the material surface absorbs heat rapidly.
                
                The material, with its temperature exceeding the melting point, starts to melt, forming a melt pool.
                
                As the temperature rises, the material will evaporate and form steam, and the molten materials will be blown off under the action of steam recoil and high-speed cutting airflow.
                
                Laser beams move along the cutting path and form continuous narrow slits in the material. In this way, the cutting process is finished.
                
                Basic components
                
                Typically, a laser cutting machine contains the following components:
                
                Lasers
                
                An optical system
                
                A cutting head
                
                A CNC control system
                
                An assist system</p><br><br>

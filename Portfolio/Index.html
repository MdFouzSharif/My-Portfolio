            <h3 class="ChangeText">I am a<span class="DiffJobs">Mechanical Engineer</span></h3><br>
            <p>I am an aspiring Engineering student from Trichy pursuing my UG degree in Mechanical branch at GCE, Salem. 
        
                I have designed this space to shed a ray of understanding between myself and those who wanna know about me. The page displays just enough things about my personal space and more enough things about my professional space. 
                
                I occasionally update this space with the new articles I compose and the stories which I imagine. I hope those create a spark in the minds of the readers.
                
                You can also view some of the achievements and feats which I have accomplished through this page, providing you guys with examples of what I am capable of.
                
                My Strengths are being confident and outspoken at appropriate times and adapting to new environments with ease.
                
                In my leisure, I watch quality movies irrespective of the genre, play outdoor Cricket and try to catch up with old reading habit.
                
                So, enjoy a Dive into my Dimensions!</p><br><br>
